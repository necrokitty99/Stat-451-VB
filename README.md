QUESTION:
How does UW volleyball compare between this year and last year?
- Looking at key stats for UW, how do hitting percentage, passing percentage, and ace percentage compare from 2023 to 2024?
- Win/loss percentage from current point in season 2023 to 2024
- Comparing numbers for returners between 2023 and 2024

Our final project goal is to analyze statistics for the University of Washington Volleyball team. 
Our overall question is how does UW volleyball compare between the 2023 season and the 2024 season? 
To answer this question, we intend to use data directly from the UW volleyball staff that is coded live during matches and then cleaned afterwards. The data encapsulates every touch the players make during a match, as well as data on opponents.  
There are many statistics that can be tracked in the sport of volleyball, and we intend to look at key factors for comparison. 
The first question we will explore is looking at key statistics for UW, such as hitting percentage (number of kills - number of errors / total attack attempts), passing percentage (amount of good and medium receptions / total number of receptions), and ace percentage (total number of aces / total serves). These statistics are big numbers in volleyball and can tell us a lot about how the team is performing. 
We will also look at win/loss percentages and compare where the huskies were at last year at this same point in the season. 
We will finally look at returners and how their numbers compare from last year to this year. 
These three questions will help us have an in depth look at the players and the team, comparing the difference between this year and last year.
